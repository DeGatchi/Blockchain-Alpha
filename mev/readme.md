# MEV
- Frontrun: Adversaries observing txs then paying high tx fees and optimizing network latency to anticipate and exploit - via placing their own orders before to ensure they are mined first - ordinary users' trades.
- Priority Gas Auctions (PGAs): Bots competitively bidding up transaction fees in order to obtain priority ordering, i.e., early block position and execution, for their transactions.
- Pure revenue opportunities: A specific sub-category of DEX arbitrage representative of broader activity, these are blockchain transactions that issue multiple trades atomically through a smart contract and profit unconditionally in every traded asset.
- Miner-extractable value (MEV): We introduce the notion of MEV, value that is extractable by miners directly from smart contracts as cryptocurrency profits. One particular source of MEV is _ordering optimization (OO)_ fees, which result from a minerâ€™s control of the ordering of transactions in a particular epoch.
- Time-bandit attacks: We show that high-MEV regimes in general lead to a new attack in which miners rewrite blockchain history to steal funds allocated by smart contracts in the past.
