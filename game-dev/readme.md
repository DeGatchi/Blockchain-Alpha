# Game Development Research

## Game Design
1) Learn Unity, especially for 2d games (uses scripting language: C#). This is how everything will interact and move.
2) Learn your artwork creation tool. I.e., learn 2d art to get started bc it's budget friendly, not a ton of lighting, materials, etc so it's friendly over all platforms. Use photoshop for enviornemntal scenes -> import layers + files into Unity -> start animating w/ Spine2d (allows you to add bones + make skeletons to animate them).
3) Learn your sound design tool of choice (i.e, audacity).

## How to build a game
- Build something with replay value: pvp + pve
- Strong progression + sense of achievement: i.e, leaderboards, ranks, cosmetics, items, levels, currency
- Establish target audience: cater to casual (play anywhere) + competitive play (grinding to be the best)

### Retention
- Ranking system that brings the player coming back and want to play for longer - creates a competitive environment where the player strives for accomplishing something.
- Short term goals + a long term goal.

### Horror
- In order to keep people getting scarred, there needs to be a fear of the unknown. When players are able to develop optimal strategies, it removes fear of the unknown from the equation and thus the horror game is no longer scary. In order to prevent this from happening, the developer must have the scenarios randomly generated so it is unpredictable + affect what the player decides to do. This converts the original One Optimal Strategy (OOS) system to a system that allows for Multiple Possible Strategies (MPS). E.g., shutting off your equipment or an audio device may not always work - RNG is involved and so that would change how the player reacts and decides how to proceed, maintaining the dire unknown factor. This ensures that using the same strategy over and over will grant the player victory. You wont always know what the enemy is doing. This is what fear is. Not knowing enough information to be safe. *The take-away: having no way of guaranteeing your plan will work is the key to designing  a good horror game.*
