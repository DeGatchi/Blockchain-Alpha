# Game Development Research

## Game Design
1) Learn Unity, especially for 2d games (uses scripting language: C#). This is how everything will interact and move.
2) Learn your artwork creation tool. I.e., learn 2d art to get started bc it's budget friendly, not a ton of lighting, materials, etc so it's friendly over all platforms. Use photoshop for enviornemntal scenes -> import layers + files into Unity -> start animating w/ Spine2d (allows you to add bones + make skeletons to animate them).
3) Learn your sound design tool of choice (i.e, audacity).

## How to build a game
- Build something with replay value: pvp + pve
- Strong progression + sense of achievement: i.e, leaderboards, ranks, cosmetics, items, levels, currency
- Establish target audience: cater to casual (play anywhere) + competitive play (grinding to be the best)
